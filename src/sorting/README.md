Design Strategy #1: Brute Force

-   Directly based off problem statement
-   Try to be exhaustive
-   examples: monkey-sort, selection-sort

Design Strategy #2: Decrease and Conquer

-   Decrease the problem of size n to n-1 (or a little less), or conversely increase by 1 from 1 to n
-   examples: bubble-sort, selection-sort

Design Strategy #3: Divide and Conquer

-   Decrease the problem size by half and solve each half individually
-   examples: quick-sort, merge-sort

Design Strategy #4: Transform and Conquer

-   Change the shape of the data model eg, array to a tree
-   examples: heap-sort
